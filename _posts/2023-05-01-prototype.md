## Handy Heat Sensor


*This glove is a device that enables you to make better decisions when you are most vulnerableâ€”during a fire. During a fire, a hot door may signal that the fire is closer than you realize, and to open the door may cause for the fire to spread into the room you are in and put your life at danger. Instead of opening the door, don the Hand Heat Sensor, set the switch to 'on' and place the back of your hand near the door. If the led is red, choose another egress, if it is green, you are good to leave out the door and egress asap. If you cannot escape at all, then turn the sensor off and a distress signal will sound.*
