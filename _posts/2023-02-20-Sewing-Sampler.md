# Look what I did...

![The back of a piece of fabric, it was hand sewn into a crude circle. Blue thread is everywhere](https://DMMeyers.github.io/assets/img/back.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## That was the back, I reckon if I show the back first, the first will not look so bad...with that being said, here is the front.

![The front of the same piece of fabric, there is an assorment of different stitch patterns with blue thread, the best part is a back stitch pattern which says Williams](https://DMMeyers.github.io/assets/img/front.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### I know it is not pretty, but I spent a lot of time on this, and if I had to do it again, it would be marginally better. Ultimately, there is only one way to get better, keep sewing. However, toward the end, my friend gave me this circular holder thing which allowed me to keep the fabric taught, this tool was a god send. My advice would be to make sure you have one of those.
