## The Assignment:

*Write a C-program called sweater-abc1.c (where abc1 is your Unix username). This program will print out the answers to the following questions, using arithmetic. You will have an integer variable called temperature that the programmer can set to have any integer value. Depending on temperature, your program will output a statement to describe the appropriate weather gear for that temperature (i.e., if it's below 60 degrees, your program may write something like "SWEATER WEATHER", if it's above a certain temperature it should say something different). Here are some constraints to address:*

## Project Advice

Do not use the 'or' command unless you have few conditons or outliers. I placed the command attempting to denote that the temp from a to b should be x, and made a statement such as "If temp is greater than 30 or less than 40" which was not a false statment, but if the temp was 20, this would also be true. The 'and' command would have to be used to create a range in this way.
