## How the heck are ya!?

My name, as you can see it plastered all over this website, is Dalton Meyers. I am a first year at Williams College. I am still exploring the many areas of study that this great college offers, but my likely majors will be in Stats or Econ AND Japanese.

As far as my experience with sewing goes, I made an apron in 8th grade during a home-ec class, though I do not have any recollection on how to do anything. My programming experience, however, is even less. I am in this class because I see immense value in these skills though especially in the combination of them. What I hope to take from this class most of all is the confidence to begin learning to program on my own and the ability to use a sewing machine once again.

One boring thing you ought to know about me is... I am lactose tolerant.


That being said, here is a picture of a few years back, chilling with my monkey friend who I met on a walk one morning in Singapore.
