# This Project...

Was a culmination of putting together a few pieces that we have done in the past. Our goal was to create 3 led flashing patterns that mimic those of different fireflys. The three modes we created were : flashbulb, big dipper and synchronous. 

Here are pictures of all of my projects lighting up.

### The advice I would give my past self is to make one change at a time and then see how it affects the leds. I found that doing this I was able to identify that I was putting the "timer += interval;" in the wrong place as well as the delay.
