## The Assignment:

*Write a program that plays a song through the buzzer when an attached slide switch is closed.*

## Project Advice

Two piece of advice. For one, make sure you are using the serial monitor early and often, that slowed us down a little on the integration of the music. And second, choose a song you already cannot tolerate. For the love of fresh air, do not pick a song you enjoy, you will grow to despise it to a point of no end. The end.
