## In a world where...

A man is in an etextiles class and is tasked with the impossible: Turn on a random pwm led every second BUT theres a catch... if the light is already turned on , then it must then be prompted to turn off. AND ALSO, when the lights do come on, the level must be random.


# I struggled for a few hours

Why? Honestly, I thought I knew exactly how to do this before I even sat down and I came in confident. I first started by making sure I can have the lights come on randomly at a random levelâ€” ez. Then I knew I needed another array which would hold the status of the light. The part I struggled with was ensuring the values were actually changing.. thing is,,, they were not. It took me a while to realize I should create an element integer, something the two arrays have in common. For some reason I was using my randPWM pin variable in my conditionals and telling it "if status(randPWM == 0)". The Problem was, randPWM was a variable used to select the pin element, so the values were 6,7,8.
