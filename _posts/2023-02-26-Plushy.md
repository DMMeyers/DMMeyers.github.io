# This Project...

Was our first experience with circuits and our second assignment with a sewing component. The goal was to use the skills we have learned so far to create a "plushy"—a mushroom shaped monster— and sew 3 led's on the front and connect the leds to a switch and a button. No lights will show without the button being depressed. The switch is placed in the circuit so as to isolate 2 of the 3 leds. When the switch is off and the button is on, only the lower led will light. When the switch is on and the button is pressed, all three leds will light.

### The advice I would give... is a lot. First, I did not know that a running stitch was required for connecting components to each other, so I did not do this and found difficulties when folding the plushy up. So, use a running stitch to connect your components. The second major thing, and I wish I had done this, place the button on the hand or foot, a flat sturdy place that is easy to put under pressure. In hindsight, I would have put the button on a front hand as if to say "Press me".
