# This Project...

Ordered us to use our creativity to created a simple circuit that can light up one led and had two different switches, one made with conductive fabric and one made from other conductive materials. I decided to use a simple oragami from and a piece of aluminum. When the frog is depressed, the aluminum strip connects two different conductive thread satin stiches.

### The advice I would give to my past self is that super glue does not work well on aluminum foil. Use tape.
