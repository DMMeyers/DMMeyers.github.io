## The Assignment:

*Write a program in arduino that illuminates an off board led a random color for the duration a button is pressed.*

## Project Advice

I struggled for a quite a while, pun forcefully intended, on my while loop. Ultimately the advice I would give to my younger self would be to consider the state of the button and the state of the variable. Once I realized that I needed to tell the computer in the while loop to check the button pin again, the project was done.
