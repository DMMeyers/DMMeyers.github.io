## Handy Heat Sensor


*This glove is a device that enables you to make better decisions when you are most vulnerableâ€”during a fire. During a fire, a hot door may signal that the fire is closer than you realize, and to open the door may cause for the fire to spread into the room you are in and put your life at danger. Instead of opening the door, don the Hand Heat Sensor, set the switch to 'on' and place the back of your hand near the door. If the led is red, choose another egress, if it is green, you are good to leave out the door and egress asap. If you cannot escape at all, then turn the sensor off and a distress signal will sound.*

### Material List

- Leather Glove
- Lilypad USB Plus
- 2 LEDS
- 1 buzzer
- 1 on/off switch
- 1 temp sensor
- Heat resistant adhesive
- conductive thread
- 30 minute battery for arduino

### State: Egress
*If the LED is green, egress through the door you are checking*

### State: Stay
*If the LED is red, do not leave through the door you were checking, fire is likely on the otherside.*

### State: Distress 
*If you have no escpae, turn the switch nearest bottom to on and a distress signal will sound from the buzzer*

3 tips to my past self
1. Do not use a leather glove to sew onto
2. Do not use a lighter to test the temp sensor, and if you do, be careful not to burn the sensor -_-
3. Use glue to affix the components inplace while you connect the conductive threads
