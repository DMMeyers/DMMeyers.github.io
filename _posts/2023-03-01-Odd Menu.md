# This Project...

Challenged me to create two menus (of food) with 3 meal options for each menu. What menu you get depends upon whether the number you choose is even (regular) or odd (secret). This was the first time I used nested if/else statements. 

Here is an example of the output! This person ordered the third option from the secret menu.

![Coded output that reads "Secret Menu! Frozen Aqua with melted snow dipping sauce](https://DMMeyers.github.io/assets/img/menu.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}


### The advice I would give to my past self is to put semicolons after the variable assigment in the first if statement.
