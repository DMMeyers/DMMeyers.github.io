**M**y name is Dalton Meyers and I love to tinker. I discovered this love during the 6 years I spent as technician in the US Navy. 3 years ago, I left the service, and am now a first year student at Williams College challenging myself to be all I can be. It is in this pursuit that I enrolled into etextiles this spring. With the circuitry, sewing and programming skills I am developing, I will garner key insights into the process of creation and problem solving in the modern age.
