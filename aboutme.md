My name is Dalton Meyers. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a ~~great~~ mustache
- I'm _extremely_ loyal to my family

What else do you need?

:# __My story__:

I am a first year student at Williams College. Before coming to Williams, I spent 6 years serving in the US Navy. The time I spent in the Navy allowed me to mature and helped me decide how I wanted to live the rest of my life. While I was in the Navy, I lived in Japan for nearly __4 years__! It was the first time I had been out of the country and it was genuinely life changeing.

... My aim is to major in Japanese and either math/stats/econ or CS (who knows?). I recognize that I may seem intimidating at first, but please know that I am friendly once you start talking to me and I am always interested in conversation.

... __IT GREAT TO MEET YOU!!!__


... If you want to know more, I encouage you to watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions :)
